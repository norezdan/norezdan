- 👋 Hi, I’m Daniel (@norezdan).
- 👀 I’m interested in biostatistics & epidemiological research. I have a wealth of experience working with researchers
      across various disciplines, specifically in clinical settings. This includes everything beginning with the
      research question all the way through peer-reviewed publication.  
- 👨‍🔧 You can view some of my published work on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=sww7ZWkAAAAJ). But since
      you're here, I added some work samples to various repos. For example, Some-Stats has examples of parametric hypothesis testing,
      while Some-Reg has different regression models. 
- 🖥️ My programming experience:
  - SAS
  - R
  - Python
  - SQL
  - STATA (kinda, this was a long time ago 🤷‍♂️) 
- 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on career opportunities 
- 📫 How to reach me..well..please reference my job application for 📱 and/or 📧
